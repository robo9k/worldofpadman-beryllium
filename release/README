  :: Installation
  
  The usual distribution includes a "vm/qagame.qvm". You need to
  copy this file into a "vm/" folder below your mod's folder.
  The full path depends on your fs_homepath (and fs_basepath)
  and fs_game (and fs_basegame ) setting.
  One example is "/home/wopded/.padman/beryllium/vm/qagame.qvm".

  Note that you do not need really to use a separate mod folder,
  since beryllium is a serverside mod. You could use the default
  fs_game folder as well, i.e. "wop".
  This is a good idea, since beryllium does not change gameplay,
  and thus there is no real need to indicate the use of a mod
  to the clients.
  
  Plus since this is a serverside mod, you do not need to serve
  beryllium's files via autodownload.
  
  If you do not change any of the default settings, beryllium
  will almost behave as the vanilla game.
  Do not hesitate to take a look at the included "beryllium.cfg"
  for some recommended settings.
  
  
  :: Variables
  
  Please note that beryllium does not check cvars for sane
  values, since it is assumed that admins know what they
  are doing :)
  
    :: be_version
    A read-only cvar that indicates the beryllium version.
  
  
    :: g_version
    A read-only cvar that indicates the codebase being used.
  
  
    :: be_voteDuration
    How long a vote lasts. Time is in seconds. Will only take
    effect for votes called after changing the cvar.
  
  
    :: be_allowedVotes
    List of allowed votes. Each vote name needs to be
    enclosed in "/".
    Take a look at the default value.
  
  
    :: be_votePause
    General pause between votes. Time is in seconds.
  
  
    :: be_voteRate
    How often a client can call a vote. Time is in seconds.
  
  
    :: be_votePass
    How many clients need to vote yes for a vote to pass.
    This is a minimum, i.e. the actual number of clients has
    to be above.
    This is a fraction from 0.0 to 1.0
  
  
    :: be_respawnProtect
    After respawning, clients don't take and handle damage.
    Time is in seconds. There is no notification whether you
    or a target are (still) protected.
  
  
    :: be_maxVotes
    Maximum number of votes per client. This gets reset at
    map change or restart.
  
  
    :: be_switchTeamTime
    Minimum pause between team changes for players in seconds.
  
  
    :: be_maxNameChanges
    Number of times a client can rename. Does not apply while
    the client is connecting.
    Will stick to the last name before hitting limit.
    Set to -1 for unlimited (default vanilla behaviour) renames.
  
  
    :: be_maxConnections
    Maximum number of connections per IP, connections above
    the limit are rejected with an error message.
    This defeats tools like q3fill almost entirely (you could
    furthermore set sv_timeout to a low value).
    If set to default of 0, unlimited connections are allowed.
  
  
    :: be_checkGUIDs
    This is a bitmask, supporting the following flags:
      1 - Reject empty GUIDs
      2 - Reject invalid GUIDs
  
    With wrong game installations, the GUID of players may
    sometimes be empty, but this is a rare case.
    Cheat tools like aimbots etc. tend to change the GUID to
    invalid values.
  
    A valid GUID is exactly 32 chars long and only consists
    of 0-9 and A-F.
  
    Please also read ioquake's README concerning the purpose
    of cl_guid!
  
  
    :: be_campDistance
    If greater than zero, this is the the distance in units
    the players have to move each second. If they do not, they
    are considered camping and after 20 seconds killed.
  
  
    :: be_checkPings
    Will check the ping of each connected and playing player
    every second and kicks if the ping is not within sv_minping
    and sv_maxping or if there were no recent packets for longer
    than the variable's value.
  
  
    :: be_oneUp
    Players get an extra life in LPS each be_oneUp kills.
  
  
    :: be_noSecrets
    If enabled, players can no longer use specific teleporters
    and movers.
    When using disabled teleporters, players will be taken to a
    random spawnpoint instead.
  
    Changes will only take effect when loading a new map. Watch
    out for error messages ;)
    Take a look at the included "maps/wop_diner.cfg" as an example.
  
  
    :: be_debugSecrets
    Will print debug output to players using teleporters and
    movers, which can be used for be_noSecrets.
    This cvar has the cheat flag and can thus only be set in
    combination with devmap.
  
  
    :: be_hideChat
    If set, will hide chat prefixed with this string. E.g. if you
    set it to "!", chat text like "!kick me" will only be written
    to the logfile and echoed back to you, but not be send to
    anyone else.
    This is useful to reduce chat spam when using tools like B3.


    :: be_banFile
    Path where to save bans from beryllium's GUID ban system.


    :: g_truePing
    Taken from the unlagged code, will do exactly the same.
    Read their README if you wish to known more.


    :: g_friendlyFire
    Now works with fractions, i.e. "0.5" to cause half the damage
    to your teammates.


    :: be_selfDamage
    Like the modified g_friendlyFire. The fraction of damage you
    will do to yourself.


    :: be_chatFlags
    This is a bitmask, supporting the following flags:
      1 - Swap say and say_team
      2 - Spectators can only use say_team (and tell)


    :: g_q3Items
    This has been extended by the setting "2". If set, item_health* from
    Quake3 will also be spawned. This requires a clientside mod such as modkuh.
    Otherwise the client will crash with
       ********************
       ERROR: Bad item index 42 on entity
       ********************


    :: be_overrideEntities
    When activated, will look for a file to replace the map's entities.
    There's no sample file or documentation yet, as this feature needs some
    additional work. Stay tuned!


    :: be_dmFlags
    This is a bitmask, supporting the following flags:
         1 - Reload weapons in background
         2 - Spawn with grapple
         4 - Spawn with full health and armor
         8 - Do not spawn powerups and do not drop them either
        16 - Do not spawn holdables and do not drop them either
        32 - Do not spawn armor
        64 - Do not spawn health
       128 - Do not spawn ammo, players get unlimited ammo on weapon pickup
       256 - Do not spawn weapons and do not drop them either
       512 - Killerducks neither attack their owner nor teammates and are prone to
            visionless unless very close to target
      1024 - Hand out "excellent" awards for airkills

    Option 1 and 2 require a clientside mod such as modkuh >= v9, otherwise
    clientside prediction will be wrong or the client even crashes with
       ********************
       ERROR: Couldn't find weapon 11
       ********************


    :: be_startWeapons
    If set, defines the weapons players will spawn with. If be_dmFlags has
    option NOAMMO, they will get infinite ammo, otherwise the default amount
    from weapon pickup is used.
    This is a bitmask, supporting the following flags:
          2 - Punchy
          4 - Nipper
          8 - Pumper
         16 - Balloony
         32 - Betty
         64 - Boaster
        128 - Splasher
        256 - BubbleG
        512 - Imperius

  
  :: Commands
  
    :: Client
  
    :: callvote shuffleteams
    Will do the same as the server command. Enabled by default,
    unless blacklisted with be_allowedVotes.
  
  
    :: ignore [cid]
    Allows to ignore any text chat from a given client.
    Without arguments the current list of ignored players will
    be printed.
    Given a client id, the client will either be ignored or
    unignored, it works as a toggle.
    Note that upon disconnect, clients are automatically unignored.
    You can use -1 as client id to ignore all bots.
    If the server supports it, VoIP is also disabled for
    the targets.


    :: tell_spectator text
    When spectating a player, will issue a private message to him, just
    as the normal "tell cid text" would.
  
     
    :: Server
  
    :: stell cid text
    Serverside tell chat.
  
  
    :: ssay text
    Serverside say chat.
  
  
    :: ssay_team team text
    Serverside team chat. Use r,b,s,f as team name.
  
  
    :: scp cid text
    Centerprint text to a client.
    Text will be printed in large letters in the middle of
    the screen.
  
  
    :: smp cid text
    Messageprint text to a client.
    Text will be printed in the upper right of the screen.
  
  
    :: sprint cid text
    Print text to a client.
    Text will be printed to the upper left chat area.
  
     
    You can use -1 as client id for scp, smp and sprint to send
    to every client.
    Messages sent with stell, ssay and ssay_team will use
    "server" as the player name.

    You can print newlines with scp and sprint by using "\n" in
    the text, which will get expanded to a real newline.
  
  
    :: dropclient cid [reason]
    Basically the same as clientkick, but you can supply an
    additional argument
    which will be printed.
  
  
    :: cancelvote
    Cancel a currently running vote, i.e. emulate that everyone
    voted no.
  
  
    :: shuffleteams
    In team gametypes try to even teams by splitting players
    evenly across teams.
    This does not restart the game or reset scores, except on
    players (since their scores are currently not saved on
    team changes).
  
  
    :: rename cid newname
    Rename given client to newname.
    be_maxNameChanges setting does not apply to this,
    other limits like invalid characters in name
    or multiple names do still apply (afterwards)!
    This does not add to the client's rename counter.
  
  
    :: scallvote vote
    Almost the same as client's callvote, but some restrictions
    do not apply.


    :: logprint text
    Will add an entry to the game log, just like the regular
    entries. Since this uses game logic, the entry will also
    be printed to the server console.


    :: rehashguids
    Reload GUID bans from disk.


    :: listguids
    Print all GUID bans.


    :: flushguids
    Delete all GUID bans, also on disk.


    :: banguid cid|guid
    Add a GUID to the list, either using a client id of a connected player, or
    by supplying the GUID directly.


    :: delguid id|guid
    Delete a GUID from the list, either by using an id from listguids or by
    supplying the GUID directly.


    :: handicap cid handicap
    Sets a players handicap value. Will take effect immediately.
    The player can still decide to override his setting again.


    :: forceteam cid team
    Forces a player into the given team regardsless of any limits.

    Locks or unlocks the given team. Teams will remain locked until nextmap.


    :: runas cid command
    Runs a command as another player.


    :: sound filename
    Plays the sound globally on the server. Be aware that there is a limit
    of the maximum number of sounds. If you reach it, the server will crash.

    


  :: Other changes
  
    Beryllium also includes some changes to the game which are
    mandatory and can not be configured at all.
  
   * Beryllium automatically renames players, preventing
     multiple players having the same name.
   * Several names are now forbidden, e.g. "server".
   * Players should no longer be able to use non-existant skins.
   * Quite a few sanity checks are being run against votes.
   * Some bugs in the original code have been fixed
   * Most bugfixes from WoP's bleeding edge code have been 
     backported, even those changing gameplay
   * Beryllium is mostly compatible with modkuh
  
  
  :: Versions
  
   * The current version of Beryllium is __VERSION__.
   * The code bases upon World of Padman's v1.5 gamecode and is
    thus only compatible with this version of the game.
    Due to its generic nature, it could also be applied to other
    versions or even other ioquake3 based games.
