## About

Beryllium is a serverside mod with Quality of Life extensions and bugfixes for server administrators.

You can find a more in-depth explanation of its features and how to install it in the [online `readme.txt` template](release/readme.txt),
which is also included in the [release binaries](https://github.com/robo9k/worldofpadman-beryllium/releases) you can download.

## Status

The project is currently *unmaintained*. It is archived here so you can download the latest release and the source code with full history.  
The project is currently not accepting pull requests nor bug issues.

Since it is based on World of PADMAN's source code it's licensed under GPL v2+ (SPDX `GPL-2.0-or-later`), see [COPYING.txt](COPYING.txt) and [release/copying.txt](release/copying.txt).
You are thus free to create your own fork and have its legacy live on. I'd appreciate if you contact me, @robo9k, if you do so :)

## History

According to the [commit history](https://github.com/robo9k/worldofpadman-beryllium/commits/master), Beryllium started its life all the way back in 2010 when WoP was still in version 1.2.
Initially it was mostly a clone of its namesake Quake 3 mod, which had its sourcecode available, so it was more than just inspiration :sweat_smile:

Throughout its life, Beryllium gained features that server admins asked for or I found useful or interesting myself. When originating from elsewhere, they should be listed in the credits section of the readme.
After a bit of feature creep, Beryllium got reduced to what it is now - a bunch of QoL features and bugfixes for server admins with a focus on compatibility with Quake 3 maps.

Older releases were available at (from what I recall):
* http://brain.utopia4.de/projects/beryllium/
* http://mirror.loop8.net/worldofpadman/beryllium/
* https://9k.lv/~robo/beryllium/

Those are gone for good now. Consider this the new home for Beryllium.

Please not that other than this `README.md` (commits after e379c25), the files are an untouched import of the whole git/svn history.
