  :: Description

  This is a plugin for b3 (bigbrotherbot.net), which adds functionality of
  the beryllium mod (http://brain.utopia4.de/projects/beryllium).

  IT WILL ONLY WORK WITH THE CURRENT BERYLLIUM MOD INSTALLED.

  Its main purpose is to add "VIP-votes", i.e. ingame votes which can only
  be called by certain b3 groups. To do so, disable votes for usual clients in
  your server.cfg with

    set g_allowVote "0"

  Then take a look at the plugin's settings in conf/plugin_beryllium.xml,
  especially the "callvote" section.

  The plugin furthermore adds the option to pass-through rcon commands. This is
  a rather mighty and dirty method and should thus only be allowed to trusted
  admin users.


  :: Installation

  * Install beryllium mod
  * Copy extplugins/* into b3/
  * Add to b3.xml

      <plugin name="beryllium" priority="42" config="@b3/extplugins/conf/plugin_beryllium.xml"/>

    Adjust priority to your needs.

  * forceteam
  * cancelvote
