Restructure this file; using proper layout and sort by priority!

Add g_nextmap, which is not executed immediatelly, but at map end. Maybe use already existing cvar nextmapBackUp

Use way more helper functions.
Do more sanity checks and calls to G_Error plus some debug output.

Improve vote pass. Print amount of yes-no-dontcare-required at vote end?
Allow players to change their mind? Enforce delay/maximum count

Unlagged? Or at least its serverside-only features or similar ones like anti-warp

Floodlimit chat, userinfo
NOTE: This'll cause problems, as we might need to call ClientUserinfoChanged() ourself

Mute players' chat, vote, voip etc.

Implement a ccmd /players, which lists players with their cid, name, (time, score), team, etc. to allow identifying players by cid
Maybe include netsettings

Is a command to pause the entire game usefull? Certainly quite some dirty code all around involved

There are quite a bunch of commands which are fun, but not actually usefull: slap, fling, disorient, freeze, kill, swapteams, spec999

Read custom votes from a file. Allow scallvote to have voteString, voteDisplayString, voteDuration as parameters?

Either use less colors/more equal to game's default output or add option to disable/reduce colors

Save scores on teamchange between real teams? Personal scores are not shown in scoreboard. Does team lose score on player change?
Make client time (and points) persistant across maps.
This will cause some problems (current map kill/death ratio) and irritation. Needs at least new var for totalTime, spectatorTime, (currentScore) etc.

Create sort of a help system, which at least explains votes and newly added commands.

Take care of special vote situations:
- Most players are connecting, one fully connected calls a vote

Add voteFlags variable for spectatorCallvote, spectatorVote, warmupOnly etc.

spectatedTeamChat etc.

force spectators to only see scoreboard, only follow mode, steal zcam code

default team spectator

Maybe record some stats? Those stimulate players and could be used to detect noobs or cheaters.

Give points depending on difficulty. For example less points while using padpower, more when on low health while killing with punchy.

According to rambetters iourt patches, there are more bad chars than vanilla Info_Validate() checks for

Make PickTeam() / autoteam pick the team with lower score and less human players?

Reenable botcode to use bambams and boomies or make them ingore those items

Merge b3 plugin into release? Or Move to its own repo, so revision numbers are separated?

Com_Parse* is nice, but error messages include wrong line numbers.
Remove guid format check for banlist?

Enforce usage of reason argument for kick votes?
Add new vote for map+gametype using beta framework?

Looks like bots are broken with locked teams.

Team scoreboard?

Modify upload.sh not to include login credentials, then git add

Add "vote yes" to b3 cv. beware of console client

Disallow locking spectator team?

Add func_fakebrush (e.g. for BigBalloon)(EF_INVISIBLE to fool client?) 
Add more docu, e.g. for the wop_journeyCTL example. Include entdmp?
Include contents string parser, add rotating (fakebrush)?
push to eeebox

Move changes to gameplay or requiring a mod into separate lithium mod?
When is a gameplay critical fix a plain change to gameplay?

Use BE_Alloc for guid bans, secrets
Modify BE_Alloc to return NULL instead of failing with G_Error directly, but print WARNING
Reduce poolsize (8 megs seems a little too much for those 1k config files..)

Add revival-like regeneration for lolly-carrier?

Make respawn protect less annoying

Teleport players back into map instead of dying in space void

g_teamForceBalance is broken?

bspc -reachability for be's entity replacement. Engine hack to exclude .aas from pure check? New .aas equired after all?

=-> split into beryllium and lithium mod
    beryllium should only include security and bug fixes as well as provide bare metal functionality like be_overrideEntities, be_oneUp
	lithium should include additional things that change gameplay such as be_dmFlags
    both should not include redundant stuff like tell_spectator

    remove remaining "do nothing" stubs?

upload to users.loop8.net/~brain/ foo /beryllium/files
 and include symlinks to *-current.zip
