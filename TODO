Restructure this file; using proper layout and sort by priority!

Add g_nextmap, which is not executed immediatelly, but at map end. Maybe use already existing cvar nextmapBackUp

Use way more helper functions

Improve vote pass. Print amount of yes-no-dontcare at vote end?

Unlagged?

Floodlimit chat, userinfo
NOTE: This'll cause problems, as we might need to call ClientUserinfoChanged() ourself

Mute players' chat, vote etc.
Lock a players name, team. Also globally lock teams. This will most likely cause problems with other code

Implement a ccmd /players, which lists players with their cid, name, (time, score), team, etc. to allow identifying players by cid

Is a command to pause the entire game usefull? Certainly quite some dirty code all around involved

There are quite a bunch of commands which are fun, but not actually usefull: slap, fling, disorient, freeze, kill, swapteams, spec999

Read custom votes from a file. Allow scallvote to have voteString, voteDisplayString, voteDuration as parameters?

Do more sanity checks and calls to G_Error plus some debug output.

Either use less colors/more equal to game's default output or add option to disable/reduce colors

Save scores on teamchange between real teams?
Make client time (and points) persistant across maps.
This will cause some problems (current map kill/death ratio) and irritation. Needs at least new var for totalTime, spectatorTime, (currentScore) etc.

Create sort of a help system, which at least explains votes and newly added commands.

Take care of special vote situations:
- Most players are connecting, one fully connected calls a vote

Add voteFlags variable for spectatorCallvote, spectatorVote, warmupOnly etc.

splitChat

Implement a guid filter like sv_banFile

Properly sync the versionstring in README with the actual current version (in code/game/Makefile plus svn rev).

Maybe record some stats? Those stimulate players and could be used to detect noobs or cheaters.

Give points depending on difficulty. For example less points while using padpower, more when on low health while killing with punchy. OneUp after x kills in LPS etc.

Properly strip all unwanted chars in ClientCleanname. Some whitespace cars still seem to fall through.
