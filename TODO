Restructure folders like engine code, i.e. ioquake.
Also use a more advanced Makefile, like the engine does.

Print realtime at game startup

Add g_nextmap, which is not executed immediatelly, but at map end

Use way more helper functions
Create helpers to get one or more client numbers (or -1 for world) from a string

Improve vote pass. Print amount of yes-no-dontcare at vote end?

Unlagged?

Floodlimit chat, vote, userinfo
NOTE: This'll cause problems, as we might need to call ClientUserinfoChanged() ourself

Fix encoding and linebreaks in all files..

Mute players' chat, vote etc.
Lock a players name, team. Also globally lock teams. This will most likely cause problems with other code

Implement a ccmd /players, which lists players with their cid, name, (time, score), team, etc. to allow identifying players by cid

Is a command to pause the entire game usefull? Certainly quite some dirty code all around involved

Rename player command?

There are quite a bunch of commands which are fun, but not actually usefull: slap, fling, disorient, freeze, kill, swapteams, spec999

Save scores on teamchange between real teams?

Add new votes, like shuffleteams.
