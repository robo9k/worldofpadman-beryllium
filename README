   .: Installation :.

   The usual distribution includes a file called qagame.qvm. You need to
   copy this file into a vm/ folder below your mod's folder.
   The full path depends on your fs_homepath and fs_game ( and fs_basepath )
   setting.
   Since this is a serverside mod, you do not need to serve beryllium's
   files via autodownload.


   .: Variables :.

   Please note that beryllium does not check cvars for sane values, since
   it is assumed that admins know what they are doing :)

   be_version        - A read-only cvar that indicates the beryllium version
                       in use.

   be_voteDuration   - How long a vote lasts. Time is in seconds. Will only
                       take effect for votes called after changing the cvar.

   be_allowedVotes   - List of allowed votes. Each vote needs to be enclosed
                       in //. Take a look at the default value.

   be_votePause      - General pause between votes. Time is in seconds.

   be_voteRate       - How often a client can call a vote. Time is in seconds.

   be_votePass       - How many clients need to vote yes for a vote to pass.
                       This is a minimum, i.e. the actual number of clients
                       has to be above. This is a fraction from 0.0 to 1.0.

   be_respawnProtect - After respawning, clients don't take and handle damage.
                       Time is in seconds. There is no notification whether
                       you or a target are (still) protected.


   .: Commands :.

      .: Client :.

      
      .: Server :.

      tell cid text
         Send a connected client some text.
         Clientnum can be -1 to print to everyone.
         Text is printed as-is to client.

      cancelvote
         Cancel a currently running vote, i.e.
         emulate that everyone voted no.

      shuffleteams
         In team gametypes try to even teams by splitting players
         evenly across teams.
         This does not restart the game or reset scores, except
         on players (since they are currently not saved on team
         changes).


   .: Other changes :.

   Beryllium automatically renames players, preventing multiple players having the same name.
   A new "shuffleteams" vote has been added, which is equal the new server command.
   Players should no longer be able to use non-existant skins.
