   .: Installation :.

   The usual distribution includes a file called qagame.qvm. You need to
   copy this file into a vm/ folder below your mod's folder.
   The full path depends on your fs_homepath and fs_game ( and fs_basepath )
   setting.
   Since this is a serverside mod, you do not need to serve beryllium's
   files via autodownload.


   .: Variables :.

   Please note that beryllium does not check cvars for sane values, since
   it is assumed that admins know what they are doing :)

   be_version       - A read-only cvar that indicates the beryllium version
                      in use.

   be_voteDuration  - How long a vote lasts. Time is in seconds. Will only
                      take effect for votes called after changing the cvar.

   be_allowedVotes  - List of allowed votes. Each vote needs to be enclosed
                      in //. Take a look at the default value.
