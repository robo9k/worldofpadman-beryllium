   .: Installation :.

   The usual distribution includes a file called qagame.qvm. You need to
   copy this file into a vm/ folder below your mod's folder.
   The full path depends on your fs_homepath (and fs_basepath) and fs_game (and fs_basegame )
   setting.
   Since this is a serverside mod, you do not need to serve beryllium's
   files via autodownload.


   .: Variables :.

   Please note that beryllium does not check cvars for sane values, since
   it is assumed that admins know what they are doing :)

   be_version        - A read-only cvar that indicates the beryllium version
                       in use.

   g_version         - A read-only cvar that indicates the codebase being used
                       by beryllium.

   be_voteDuration   - How long a vote lasts. Time is in seconds. Will only
                       take effect for votes called after changing the cvar.

   be_allowedVotes   - List of allowed votes. Each vote needs to be enclosed
                       in //. Take a look at the default value.

   be_votePause      - General pause between votes. Time is in seconds.

   be_voteRate       - How often a client can call a vote. Time is in seconds.

   be_votePass       - How many clients need to vote yes for a vote to pass.
                       This is a minimum, i.e. the actual number of clients
                       has to be above. This is a fraction from 0.0 to 1.0

   be_respawnProtect - After respawning, clients don't take and handle damage.
                       Time is in seconds. There is no notification whether
                       you or a target are (still) protected.

   be_maxVotes       - Maximum number of votes per client. This gets reset
                       at map change or restart.

   be_switchTeamTime - Minimum pause between team changes for players in seconds.

   be_maxNameChanges - Number of times a client can rename. Does not apply while
                       players are connecting. Will stick to the last name
                       before hitting limit. Set to -1 for unlimited (default
                       behaviour) renames.

   be_maxConnections - Maximum number of connections per IP, players above are
                       rejected.
                       This defeats tools like q3fill almost entirely (you could
                       furthermore set sv_timeout to a low value).
                       If set to default of 0, unlimited connections are allowed.

   be_checkGUIDs     - This is a bitmask, supporting the following flags:
                          1 - Reject empty GUIDs
                          2 - Reject invalid GUIDs

                       Please note that World of Padman v1.1 did not yet use
                       GUIDs, so people using the old (v1.2 compatible) engine
                       will be rejected for emtpy GUIDs.
                       A valid GUID is exactly 32 chars long and only consists
                       of 0-9 and A-F. Cheat tools like aimbots etc. sometimes
                       change the GUID to invalid values.

                       Please also read ioquake's README concerning the purpose
                       of cl_guid!

   be_campDistance   - If greater than zero, this is the the distance in units
                       the players have to move each second. If they do not, they
                       are considered camping and after 20 seconds killed.

   be_checkPings     - Will check the ping of each connected and playing player
                       every second and kicks if the ping is not
                       within sv_minping and sv_maxping or if there were no recent
                       packets for longer than the variable value.

   be_oneUp          - Players get an extra life in LPS each be_oneUp kills.


   .: Commands :.

      .: Client :.

      A new "shuffleteams" vote has been added, whose behaviour is equal to the new server command.

      
      .: Server :.

      stell cid text
         Serverside tell chat.

      ssay text
         Serverside say chat.

      ssay_team team text
         Serverside team chat. Use red/r etc. as teamname.

      scp cid text
         Centerprint text to a client.
         Text will be printed in large letters in the middle of the screen.

      smp cid text
         Messageprint text to a client.
         Text will be printed in the upper right of the screen.

      sprint cid text
         Print text to a client.
         Text will be printed to the upper left chat area.

      
      You can use -1 as client id for scp, smp and sprint to send to every client.
      Messages sent with stell, ssay and ssay_team will use "server" as playername.


      dropclient cid reason
         Basically the same as clientkick, but you can supply an
         additional argument which will be displayed.

      cancelvote
         Cancel a currently running vote, i.e.
         emulate that everyone voted no.

      shuffleteams
         In team gametypes try to even teams by splitting players
         evenly across teams.
         This does not restart the game or reset scores, except
         on players (since their scores are currently not saved on
         team changes).

      rename cid newname
         Rename given client to newname.
         be_maxNameChanges setting does not apply to this,
         other limits like invalid characters in name
         or multiple names do still apply (afterwards)!
         This does not add to the client's rename counter.

      scallvote vote
         Almost the same as client's callvote, but some restrictions
         do not apply.


   .: Other changes :.

   Beryllium automatically renames players, preventing multiple players having the same name.
   Several names are now forbidden, e.g. "server".
   Players should no longer be able to use non-existant skins.
   Quite a few sanity checks are being run against votes.
   Some bugs in the original code have been fixed.


   .: Versions :.

   This README applies to the current version of Beryllium, which is 0.10a-r79.
   The code bases upon World of Padman's v1.5 gamecode and is thus only compatible
   with this version of the game. Due to its generic nature, it could also be applied
   to other versions or even other ioquake3 based games though.
