   .: Installation :.

   The usual distribution includes a file called qagame.qvm. You need to
   copy this file into a vm/ folder below your mod's folder.
   The full path depends on your fs_homepath and fs_game ( and fs_basepath )
   setting.
   Since this is a serverside mod, you do not need to serve beryllium's
   files via autodownload.


   .: Variables :.

   Please note that beryllium does not check cvars for sane values, since
   it is assumed that admins know what they are doing :)

   be_version        - A read-only cvar that indicates the beryllium version
                       in use.

   be_voteDuration   - How long a vote lasts. Time is in seconds. Will only
                       take effect for votes called after changing the cvar.

   be_allowedVotes   - List of allowed votes. Each vote needs to be enclosed
                       in //. Take a look at the default value. Please note
                       that this is case sensitive, everything needs to be
                       lowercase!

   be_votePause      - General pause between votes. Time is in seconds.

   be_voteRate       - How often a client can call a vote. Time is in seconds.

   be_votePass       - How many clients need to vote yes for a vote to pass.
                       This is a minimum, i.e. the actual number of clients
                       has to be above. This is a fraction from 0.0 to 1.0.

   be_respawnProtect - After respawning, clients don't take and handle damage.
                       Time is in seconds.
